# **Welcome to Linea!**

This is a C++ library built on top of SDL to work with simple 3D Graphics.
The work-flow is really linear (hence the name) so it allows you to create your cute indie 3D games!
The library has many modules which you can also use independently

# Math

The math module includes many functions and classes for operations to make your games.
For, example `fctr` returns the factorial of the number;
```
fctr(5);
```
This example returns 120.
